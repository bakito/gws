# gws - Google Cloud Workstation Utils

A command-line tool to manage Google Cloud Workstations.

## Description

`gws` is a utility to simplify the management of Google Cloud Workstations. It provides commands to start, stop, and connect to your workstation, as well as manage your configuration.

## Installation

You can install `gws` by downloading a binary from the [latest release]( https://github.com/bakito/gws/releases/tag/v0.2.0) or via go by using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/bakito/gws@latest
```

## Usage

### Commands

- `gws setup`: Create a new or update the config.yaml and create a context configuration using an interactive terminal setup wizard.
- `gws start [context]`: Start the workstation for the given or current context.
- `gws stop [context]`: Stop the workstation for the given or current context.
- `gws restart [context]`: Restart the workstation for the given or current context.
- `gws status`: List all configured workstations with their state.
- `gws up`: Uploads files and directories to the workstation as defined in the context configuration.
- `gws down`: Download files and directories from the workstation as defined in the context configuration.
- `gws tunnel [context]`: Create an SSH tunnel to the workstation.
- `gws patch`: Patch local gcloud cli files as defined in the `filePatches` configuration.
- `gws ctx [context]`: Switch the current context. If no context is provided, an interactive selection is shown.
  - `--current`: Print the current active context.
- `gws scripts win-reconnect-ssh`: Generate a Windows SSH reconnect script.

### Global Flags

- `--config`: Path to the configuration file (default: `~/.config/gws/config.yaml`).
- `--ctx`: The context to use.

## Configuration

`gws` is configured using a YAML file (default: `~/.config/gws/config.yaml`). You can use the `gws setup` command to create an initial configuration.

The configuration file can contain multiple contexts. Each context defines the connection details for a specific workstation.

### `config.yaml` example
